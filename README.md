## Experimental build for a 3-D HTML / CSS Portfolio Layout
I wanted to experiment with 3-D CSS transforms and try to create a portfolio
layout built on 3-D transformed HTML elements

Data is populated by my existing portfolio site using the Wordpress API plugin
with customized data fields on the GET call for meta fields and all image URLS
